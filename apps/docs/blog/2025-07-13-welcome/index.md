SafeTravels was a pet project of mine that I used while I was traveling through Norway on a motorcycle. With that journey now in the past I decided to turn this pet project into something more. A self hosted travel platform available for everyone, for free.

But the platform in it's current state is far from usable. The two main issues are that the app is not user-friendly, and setting up the platform takes time and knowledge. I hope to curb these issues over the next few months.
