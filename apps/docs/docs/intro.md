# Safe Travels

# Warning

Safe Travels is not yet ready for general use. Feel free to take a professional interest or contribute, but consider the application to be in early beta.

# Intro

SafeTravels is a privacy friendly travel diary for self hosting. This allows users to be in control of their own data and to share it with other people, such as family or friends.

But getting started is not as user friendly as comparable platforms. This guide should help most users get a basic SafeTravels setup running, but be aware some basic technical knowledge is still required in the current version.

If you do encounter any issues, please check the [Github issues](https://github.com/tea-lover-418/safe-travels/issues), and if you can't find a report of the same problem please let us know!
